# Space-Invaders
The classic game, Space Invaders made fast by being parallelly programmed in C using Posix multithreading. 

The space ships come down as 'O' , and the canon shoots upwards as '^'. They are both on a timer. Every space ship has a fixed speed (number of boxes travelled per unit time). Similarly, each missile has a speed. Both their speeds have been made same for the basic version. It is intended for the later versions to have differnt speeds and a fixed ammunation, differnt levels of difficulty, etc. 

Kindly note that the game has recently been found to have some bugs in it's critical section contentions. The amends will be made using synchronization primitives. The bugs are intended to be fixed by the end of February and hopefully a new version of the game with new levels will also soon be launched. Thankyou for your patience and have fun playing SPACE-INVADERS!!
