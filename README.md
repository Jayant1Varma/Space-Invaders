# Space-Invaders
The classic game, Space Invaders made fast by being parallelly programmed in C using Posix multithreading. 

The space ships come down as 'O' , and the canon shoots upwards as '^'. They are both on a timer. Every space ship has a fixed speed (number of boxes travelled per unit time). Similarly, each missile has a speed. Both their speeds have been made same for the basic version. It is intended for the later versions to have differnt speeds and a fixed ammunation, differnt levels of difficulty, etc. 

Kindly note that the game has recently been found to have some bugs in it's critical section contentions. The amends will be made using synchronization primitives. The bugs are intended to be fixed by the end of February and hopefully a new version of the game with new levels will also soon be launched. Thankyou for your patience and have fun playing SPACE-INVADERS!!

Update- 4th June 2023: The bugs have still not been fixed. I've been too much preoccupied with my courses, and personal life to work on this for now. I have midterms coming up, so it's not realistic for me to say the game will be finished by end June, although I'll try. If it does, you'll see a huge celebration animation on my website ;)

Once again, thank you for your patience, and I will work diligently to finish the game to perfection by August at most.
